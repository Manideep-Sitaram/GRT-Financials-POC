The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash generation in 2023 compared to 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been impacted by these changes in revenue, gross profit, and operating profit.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and increase in interest expenses, leading to a decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2023 compared to the previous year. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and ability to fund its operations and investments.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.", 'pageNumbers': [102, 116, 70, 126]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit             | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net               | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net         | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8           | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 118, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [119, 54, 119, 163]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [116, 209, 126, 147]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and financial stability.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term sustainability and profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and other expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in revenue and profitability, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to the previous year.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating loss.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a substantial decline from the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring costs incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decrease in net profit and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. This could have implications for the company's ability to fund its operations, investments, and debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategies to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6        |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0       |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5        |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8      |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0      |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0   | $ 26.0       |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2        |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)    | -            |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6    |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5        |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4    |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash to meet operational needs or invest in growth opportunities.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects a challenging year with declines in key financial metrics.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, as well as higher interest expenses. The decrease in cash flow from operations could have limited the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or meet its financial obligations. Overall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects the challenges it faced in generating revenue, managing costs, and maintaining profitability. \n\nThe top two reasons for the decline in revenue and gross profit margin could be attributed to changes in consumer preferences or market trends, as well as increased competition from rival companies.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategic measures to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| Intangible Amortization Expense    | $341.5            | $350.4            |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2            | $383.0            |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5          | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA        | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | Current Year (2023) | Previous Year (2022) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4                |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9              |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0              |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2              |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided          |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year. Additionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses, with a net expense of $417.9 million in 2023 compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in profitability and increase in expenses could have put pressure on the company's cash flow generation, affecting its ability to fund operations or investments.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year reflect the company's financial performance and strategic decisions.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, as well as impairment charges related to goodwill and mineral rights. These expenses likely impacted the company's overall profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels. The higher interest expenses may have put pressure on the company's financial performance and cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was impacted by various factors such as declining revenue, lower gross profit margin, increased operating losses, higher interest expenses, and potentially lower cash flow from operations.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. The company may have faced challenges in managing its working capital or generating sufficient cash flow from its core operations.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net sales and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating losses. This could have resulted in reduced cash flows available for reinvestment in the business or for servicing debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the decline in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and increase in interest expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 highlight the challenges faced by the company in managing its financial performance. The top two reasons for these changes could be attributed to external economic factors impacting consumer demand and increased costs of operations, as well as internal factors such as restructuring costs and impairment charges affecting profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0           | $21,256.5           |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5           | $17,237.5           |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5            | $4,019.0            |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions.\n\nThe gross profit also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin could be due to an increase in the cost of goods sold, which amounted to $17,237.5 million in 2022 and $16,725.5 million in 2023. This increase in the cost of goods sold could be a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions, or higher production costs.\n\nOperating profit showed a significant decrease from $1,326.8 million in 2022 to a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and lower gross profit margins.\n\nNet profit also experienced a significant decrease, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023 compared to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in net profit could be due to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and lower revenue.\n\nInterest expenses increased from $318.8 million in 2022 to $417.9 million in 2023. This increase in interest expenses could be a result of higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nCash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decrease in revenue, lower gross profit margins, and higher operating expenses. Additionally, any changes in working capital management or capital expenditures could also affect cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was weaker compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower revenue, higher operating expenses, and impairment charges.
