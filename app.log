The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash generation in 2023 compared to 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been impacted by these changes in revenue, gross profit, and operating profit.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and increase in interest expenses, leading to a decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2023 compared to the previous year. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and ability to fund its operations and investments.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.", 'pageNumbers': [102, 116, 70, 126]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit             | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net               | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net         | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8           | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 118, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [119, 54, 119, 163]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [116, 209, 126, 147]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and financial stability.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term sustainability and profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and other expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in revenue and profitability, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to the previous year.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating loss.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a substantial decline from the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring costs incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decrease in net profit and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. This could have implications for the company's ability to fund its operations, investments, and debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategies to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6        |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0       |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5        |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8      |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0      |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0   | $ 26.0       |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2        |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)    | -            |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6    |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5        |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4    |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash to meet operational needs or invest in growth opportunities.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects a challenging year with declines in key financial metrics.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, as well as higher interest expenses. The decrease in cash flow from operations could have limited the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or meet its financial obligations. Overall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects the challenges it faced in generating revenue, managing costs, and maintaining profitability. \n\nThe top two reasons for the decline in revenue and gross profit margin could be attributed to changes in consumer preferences or market trends, as well as increased competition from rival companies.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategic measures to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| Intangible Amortization Expense    | $341.5            | $350.4            |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2            | $383.0            |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5          | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA        | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | Current Year (2023) | Previous Year (2022) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4                |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9              |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0              |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2              |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided          |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year. Additionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses, with a net expense of $417.9 million in 2023 compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in profitability and increase in expenses could have put pressure on the company's cash flow generation, affecting its ability to fund operations or investments.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year reflect the company's financial performance and strategic decisions.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, as well as impairment charges related to goodwill and mineral rights. These expenses likely impacted the company's overall profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels. The higher interest expenses may have put pressure on the company's financial performance and cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was impacted by various factors such as declining revenue, lower gross profit margin, increased operating losses, higher interest expenses, and potentially lower cash flow from operations.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. The company may have faced challenges in managing its working capital or generating sufficient cash flow from its core operations.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net sales and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating losses. This could have resulted in reduced cash flows available for reinvestment in the business or for servicing debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the decline in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and increase in interest expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 highlight the challenges faced by the company in managing its financial performance. The top two reasons for these changes could be attributed to external economic factors impacting consumer demand and increased costs of operations, as well as internal factors such as restructuring costs and impairment charges affecting profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0           | $21,256.5           |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5           | $17,237.5           |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5            | $4,019.0            |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions.\n\nThe gross profit also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin could be due to an increase in the cost of goods sold, which amounted to $17,237.5 million in 2022 and $16,725.5 million in 2023. This increase in the cost of goods sold could be a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions, or higher production costs.\n\nOperating profit showed a significant decrease from $1,326.8 million in 2022 to a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and lower gross profit margins.\n\nNet profit also experienced a significant decrease, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023 compared to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in net profit could be due to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and lower revenue.\n\nInterest expenses increased from $318.8 million in 2022 to $417.9 million in 2023. This increase in interest expenses could be a result of higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nCash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decrease in revenue, lower gross profit margins, and higher operating expenses. Additionally, any changes in working capital management or capital expenditures could also affect cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was weaker compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower revenue, higher operating expenses, and impairment charges.

Revenue or Sales:\n- Net Operating Revenues increased from $10,980 million in 2023 to $11,300 million in 2024. This growth can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- However, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs partially offset the revenue growth.\n\n2. Gross Profit:\n- Gross Profit increased from $6,663 million in 2023 to $7,065 million in 2024. The rise in Gross Profit can be primarily attributed to the increase in Net Operating Revenues and the favorable pricing initiatives.\n- Despite the increase in Gross Profit, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs limited the growth potential.\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin:\n- The Gross Profit Margin increased from 60.7% in 2023 to 62.5% in 2024. This improvement in Gross Profit Margin was driven by the favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes.\n- However, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs had a negative effect on the Gross Profit Margin.\n\n4. Operating Profit:\n- Operating Income decreased from $3,367 million in 2023 to $2,141 million in 2024. The decline in Operating Income can be attributed to the increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges.\n- The impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also played a role in the decrease in Operating Income.\n\n5. Net Profit:\n- Consolidated Net Income increased from $3,113 million in 2023 to $3,185 million in 2024. The growth in Net Income can be attributed to the increase in Other income (loss) - net.\n- However, the impact of higher income taxes in 2024 compared to 2023 limited the growth in Net Profit.\n\n6. Interest Expenses:\n- Interest expenses increased from $372 million in 2023 to $382 million in 2024. The rise in Interest expenses can be attributed to the increase in debt or borrowing costs.\n- The increase in Interest expenses had a negative impact on the company's profitability and financial performance.\n\n7. Cash Flow from Operations:\n- The Cash Flow from Operations for the three months ended March 29, 2024, and March 31, 2023, was not provided in the context.

Total revenue increased from $22.9 billion in 2021 to $28.1 billion in 2022, representing a 22% growth. This growth was driven by an increase in both services and product sales, with services revenue growing from $15.6 billion to $19.6 billion and product sales revenue increasing from $7.3 billion to $8.5 billion. The growth in revenue can be attributed to robust year-end sales in digital services and strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East.\n\nThe increase in revenue also led to a growth in gross profit, which is the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold. In 2022, the cost of services and cost of sales increased, but the increase in revenue outpaced the rise in costs, resulting in a higher gross profit margin. This improvement in gross profit margin indicates that Schlumberger was able to effectively manage its costs while increasing sales.\n\nOperating profit, which is the profit derived from the company's core business operations, also saw an increase in 2022. This growth can be attributed to the higher revenue and improved gross profit margin. The company's ability to generate more profit from its operations indicates efficiency and effectiveness in managing expenses and maximizing revenue.\n\nNet profit, which is the bottom line profit after all expenses have been deducted from revenue, also increased in 2022. The growth in net profit can be attributed to the higher operating profit and lower interest expenses. The company's ability to reduce interest expenses indicates effective management of debt and financial obligations.\n\nCash flow from operations decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in working capital consumption. The increase in receivables and inventories consumed liquidity, offsetting the positive impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This change in working capital management impacted the cash flow from operations in 2022.

Total revenue increased from $22.9 billion in 2021 to $28.1 billion in 2022, representing a 22% growth. This growth was driven by an increase in both services and product sales, with services revenue growing from $15.6 billion to $19.6 billion and product sales revenue growing from $7.3 billion to $8.5 billion. The increase in revenue can be attributed to robust year-end sales in digital services and strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East.\n\nThe gross profit margin for Schlumberger also improved in 2022. The cost of services and cost of sales increased in line with the revenue growth, but the gross profit margin increased due to the higher revenue growth rate compared to the cost increase rate. This indicates that Schlumberger was able to effectively manage its costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\nOperating profit also saw a positive trend in 2022. Despite an increase in research and engineering expenses, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses, the overall operating profit increased due to the significant revenue growth. This indicates that Schlumberger was able to generate higher profits from its operations, even with increased expenses.\n\nNet profit for Schlumberger more than doubled in 2022 compared to 2021, with net income increasing from $1.9 billion to $3.5 billion. This significant increase in net profit can be attributed to the higher revenue and improved operational efficiency.\n\nInterest expenses decreased in 2022, which contributed to higher net profit. The decrease in interest expenses indicates that Schlumberger was able to manage its debt effectively and reduce its financial costs.\n\nCash flow from operations decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in working capital consumption. The increase in receivables and inventories consumed liquidity, offsetting the positive impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Revenue or Sales:\n- Net Operating Revenues increased from $10,980 million in 2023 to $11,300 million in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 2.9%. This growth can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- The increase in revenue was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs, which affected the overall sales performance.\n\n2. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin:\n- Gross Profit increased from $6,663 million in 2023 to $7,065 million in 2024, reflecting a growth of about 6%. This increase in gross profit can be primarily attributed to the favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- The Gross Profit Margin also improved from 60.7% in 2023 to 62.5% in 2024. This improvement was driven by the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes, although partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs.\n\n3. Operating Profit and Net Profit:\n- Operating Income decreased from $3,367 million in 2023 to $2,141 million in 2024, representing a decline of approximately 36%. This decrease can be attributed to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, as well as other operating charges incurred during the period.\n- Net Income Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company also decreased slightly from $3,107 million in 2023 to $3,177 million in 2024. This decrease can be attributed to higher income taxes incurred during the period.\n\n4. Interest Expenses and Cash Flow from Operations:\n- Interest Expenses increased from $372 million in 2023 to $382 million in 2024, reflecting a slight increase in the cost of borrowing for the company.\n- Cash Flow from Operations was not explicitly provided in the context, but it can be inferred that the company's cash flow may have been impacted by the changes in revenue, expenses, and profitability during the period.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2024 showed a mixed picture with revenue growth, improved gross profit margin, but lower operating income and slightly lower net income compared to the previous year.

This increase in revenue can be attributed to factors such as sales volume, price, product and geographic mix, and acquisitions and divestitures. However, the company expects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have an unfavorable impact on its full-year 2024 net operating revenues. This indicates that the company may face challenges in maintaining revenue growth due to external factors beyond its control.\n\nIn terms of operating profit, the company saw an improvement in performance as indicated by the increase in gross profit margin. This improvement can be attributed to the company's focus on cost management and pricing strategies. However, the company also incurred higher commodity costs, which may have put pressure on its operating profit margins.\n\nIn terms of net profit, the company's performance may have been impacted by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. These factors could have affected the company's bottom line and resulted in lower net profits compared to the previous year.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 showed improvements in gross profit margin and revenue growth, but challenges such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs may have impacted its profitability and net profit margins. Effective cost management and pricing strategies were key factors driving the positive changes in gross profit margin and revenue growth.", 'pageNumbers': [120, 33, 47], 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                           | March 29, 2024 (in millions) | March 31, 2023 (in millions) |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net Operating Revenues         | $11,300                      | $10,980                      |\n| Cost of goods sold              | $4,235                       | $4,317                       |\n| Gross Profit                    | $7,065                       | $6,663                       |\n| Selling, general and admin. expenses | $3,351                  | $3,185                      |\n| Other operating charges         | $1,573                       | $111                         |\n| Operating Income                | $2,141                       | $3,367                       |\n| Interest income                 | $246                         | $168                         |\n| Interest expense                | $382                         | $372                         |\n| Equity income (loss) -

This increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes. However, this positive impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. The increase in gross profit margin indicates that the company was able to improve its profitability before considering all operating expenses.\n\nIn terms of revenue or sales, the company saw a growth in net operating revenues. This growth was influenced by factors such as sales volume, price, product and geographic mix, as well as acquisitions and divestitures. The company's net operating revenue performance was also impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, with an expectation of an unfavorable impact on full-year 2024 revenues. The company's ability to manage these fluctuations will be crucial in maintaining revenue growth.\n\nOperating profit also saw an improvement, with management evaluating segment performance based on net operating revenues and operating income. The company's ability to monitor and address different factors affecting financial performance at the segment level has contributed to this improvement. However, it is important to note that the size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period, which can impact operating profit.\n\nIn terms of interest expenses, the company manages income taxes and treasury-related items on a global basis within Corporate. This approach helps in effectively managing interest income and expenses. The company's ability to efficiently handle these financial aspects has likely contributed to maintaining stable interest expenses.\n\nOverall, the company's performance in 2023 reflects a strategic focus on improving profitability through pricing initiatives, channel and package mix optimization, and structural changes. However, challenges such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and commodity costs continue to pose risks to the company's financial performance. Effective management of these challenges will be key to sustaining revenue growth, gross profit margin improvement, and overall profitability in the future.", 'pageNumbers': [120, 33, 47], 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                           | March 29, 2024 (in millions) | March 31, 2023 (in millions) |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net Operating Revenues         | $11,300                      | $10,980                      |\n| Cost of goods sold             | $4,235                       | $4,317                       |\n| Gross Profit                   | $7,065                       | $6,663                       |\n| Selling, general and admin. expenses | $3,351                | $3,185                       |\n| Other operating charges        | $1,573                       | $111                         |\n| Operating Income               | $2,141                       | $3,367                       |\n| Interest income                | $246                         | $168                         |\n| Interest expense               | $382                         | $372                         |\n| Equity income (loss) -

This increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes.

This improvement can be attributed to the higher gross profit margin and effective cost management strategies. However, the company also incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, which had a negative impact on net profit. The increase in interest expenses may be due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nIn terms of cash flow from operations, the company may have seen fluctuations due to changes in revenue streams, operating expenses, and investment activities.
