The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash generation in 2023 compared to 2022.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been impacted by these changes in revenue, gross profit, and operating profit.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and increase in interest expenses, leading to a decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2023 compared to the previous year. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and ability to fund its operations and investments.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.", 'pageNumbers': [102, 116, 70, 126]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit             | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net               | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net         | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8           | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 118, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [119, 54, 119, 163]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [116, 209, 126, 147]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022.

Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments. This could have implications for the company's liquidity and financial stability.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing key financial metrics to ensure the company's long-term sustainability and profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and other expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in revenue and profitability, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to the previous year.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating loss.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a substantial decline from the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring costs incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or changes in interest rates during the year.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decrease in net profit and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. This could have implications for the company's ability to fund its operations, investments, and debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategies to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| SG&A Intangible Amortization Expense | $341.5 | $350.4 |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2 | $383.0 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5           | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6        |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0       |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5        |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8      |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0      |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0   | $ 26.0       |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2        |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)    | -            |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6    |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5        |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA       | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4    |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4              |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9            |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0            |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2           |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided        |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash to meet operational needs or invest in growth opportunities.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects a challenging year with declines in key financial metrics.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the company's cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in net profit and operating profit, as well as higher interest expenses. The decrease in cash flow from operations could have limited the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or meet its financial obligations. Overall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects the challenges it faced in generating revenue, managing costs, and maintaining profitability. \n\nThe top two reasons for the decline in revenue and gross profit margin could be attributed to changes in consumer preferences or market trends, as well as increased competition from rival companies.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations highlight the importance of closely monitoring financial performance and implementing strategic measures to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Net Sales                          | $20,310.0          | $21,256.5          |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                 | $16,725.5          | $17,237.5          |\n| Gross Profit                       | $3,584.5           | $4,019.0           |\n| SG&A Expense (excluding intangible amortization) | $2,014.4 | $1,932.6 |\n| Intangible Amortization Expense    | $341.5            | $350.4            |\n| Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense | ($12.1) | $0.2 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net | $859.2            | $383.0            |\n| Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights | $1,893.0 | $26.0 |\n| Operating (Loss) Profit            | ($1,511.5)        | $1,326.8          |\n| Interest Expense, Net              | ($417.9)          | ($318.8)          |\n| Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt | $10.5          | ($8.5)            |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income | ($21.8) | $157.4 |\n| Other (Expense) Income, Net        | ($6.1)            | ($11.0)           |\n| Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities | $3.4     | $72.9             |\n| Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $238.8          | -                 |\n| Net Income                         | -                  | -                 |', 'pageNumbers': [102, 163, 116, 118]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': '| Item                               | 2023          | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ (1,649.0) | $ 944.6       |\n| Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | $ 4.8        | $ 4.6         |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense       | $ (60.4)      | $ 269.6       |\n| Other expense (income), net        | $ 6.1         | $ 11.0        |\n| (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt | $ (10.5)     | $ 8.5         |\n| Interest expense, net              | $ 417.9       | $ 318.8       |\n| Restructuring and other costs, net | $ 859.2       | $ 383.0       |\n| Impairment of goodwill and mineral rights | $ 1,893.0 | $ 26.0        |\n| Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense | $ (12.1) | $ 0.2         |\n| Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga | $ (238.8)   | -             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization | $ 1,535.8 | $ 1,488.6     |\n| Other adjustments                  | $ 232.6       | $ 4.5         |\n| Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA        | $ 2,978.6     | $ 3,459.4     |', 'pageNumbers': [163, 54, 119]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a list of all balance sheet items including items under current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity for both the current year and previous year in a tabular format', 'answer': '| Balance Sheet Items       | Current Year (2023) | Previous Year (2022) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Current Assets            | $192.4              | $227.4                |\n| Non-Current Assets        | $1,870.1            | $2,182.9              |\n| Current Liabilities       | $1,533.6            | $2,398.0              |\n| Non-Current Liabilities   | $13,529.2           | $9,970.2              |\n| Equity                    | Not provided        | Not provided          |', 'pageNumbers': [209, 147, 116, 126]}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'How much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next one year and can the company pay this from its liquidity.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, or other one-time expenses incurred during the year. Additionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses, with a net expense of $417.9 million in 2023 compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in profitability and increase in expenses could have put pressure on the company's cash flow generation, affecting its ability to fund operations or investments.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or increased borrowing costs.\n\nOn the positive side, the company reported a gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2023, which could have helped offset some of the negative impacts on the financial performance. Moreover, the company may have focused on improving its cash flow from operations in 2023, potentially through cost-cutting measures or operational efficiencies.\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, net profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations in the current year compared to the previous year reflect the company's financial performance and strategic decisions.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, as well as impairment charges related to goodwill and mineral rights. These expenses likely impacted the company's overall profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels. The higher interest expenses may have put pressure on the company's financial performance and cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was impacted by various factors such as declining revenue, lower gross profit margin, increased operating losses, higher interest expenses, and potentially lower cash flow from operations.

This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its production costs or pricing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, in contrast to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower sales figures. Additionally, the company incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, with a net expense of $417.9 million, compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses may have been due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decline in revenue and operating profit, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. The company may have faced challenges in managing its working capital or generating sufficient cash flow from its core operations.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nMoreover, the cash flow from operations may have been impacted by the decline in net sales and operating profit, leading to potential challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to support the company's operations and investments.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023, a stark contrast to the operating profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment charges, and potentially lower sales volumes.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of $417.9 million compared to $318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher debt levels or interest rates, impacting the company's overall financial performance.\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted in 2023 due to the lower net profit and operating losses. This could have resulted in reduced cash flows available for reinvestment in the business or for servicing debt obligations.\n\nOverall, the decline in revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and increase in interest expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 highlight the challenges faced by the company in managing its financial performance. The top two reasons for these changes could be attributed to external economic factors impacting consumer demand and increased costs of operations, as well as internal factors such as restructuring costs and impairment charges affecting profitability.", 'pageNumbers': [70, 126, 116, 102]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                                | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net Sales                           | $20,310.0           | $21,256.5           |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                  | $16,725.5           | $17,237.5           |\n| Gross Profit                        | $3,584.5            | $4,019.0            |\n| Selling, General and Admin.

This decline in revenue could be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions.\n\nThe gross profit also decreased from $4,019.0 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin could be due to an increase in the cost of goods sold, which amounted to $17,237.5 million in 2022 and $16,725.5 million in 2023. This increase in the cost of goods sold could be a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions, or higher production costs.\n\nOperating profit showed a significant decrease from $1,326.8 million in 2022 to a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023. This decline in operating profit could be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, and lower gross profit margins.\n\nNet profit also experienced a significant decrease, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023 compared to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in net profit could be due to higher operating expenses, impairment charges, and lower revenue.\n\nInterest expenses increased from $318.8 million in 2022 to $417.9 million in 2023. This increase in interest expenses could be a result of higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels.\n\nCash flow from operations may have been negatively impacted by the decrease in revenue, lower gross profit margins, and higher operating expenses. Additionally, any changes in working capital management or capital expenditures could also affect cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 was weaker compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower revenue, higher operating expenses, and impairment charges.

Revenue or Sales:\n- Net Operating Revenues increased from $10,980 million in 2023 to $11,300 million in 2024. This growth can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- However, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs partially offset the revenue growth.\n\n2. Gross Profit:\n- Gross Profit increased from $6,663 million in 2023 to $7,065 million in 2024. The rise in Gross Profit can be primarily attributed to the increase in Net Operating Revenues and the favorable pricing initiatives.\n- Despite the increase in Gross Profit, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs limited the growth potential.\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin:\n- The Gross Profit Margin increased from 60.7% in 2023 to 62.5% in 2024. This improvement in Gross Profit Margin was driven by the favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes.\n- However, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs had a negative effect on the Gross Profit Margin.\n\n4. Operating Profit:\n- Operating Income decreased from $3,367 million in 2023 to $2,141 million in 2024. The decline in Operating Income can be attributed to the increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges.\n- The impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also played a role in the decrease in Operating Income.\n\n5. Net Profit:\n- Consolidated Net Income increased from $3,113 million in 2023 to $3,185 million in 2024. The growth in Net Income can be attributed to the increase in Other income (loss) - net.\n- However, the impact of higher income taxes in 2024 compared to 2023 limited the growth in Net Profit.\n\n6. Interest Expenses:\n- Interest expenses increased from $372 million in 2023 to $382 million in 2024. The rise in Interest expenses can be attributed to the increase in debt or borrowing costs.\n- The increase in Interest expenses had a negative impact on the company's profitability and financial performance.\n\n7. Cash Flow from Operations:\n- The Cash Flow from Operations for the three months ended March 29, 2024, and March 31, 2023, was not provided in the context.

Total revenue increased from $22.9 billion in 2021 to $28.1 billion in 2022, representing a 22% growth. This growth was driven by an increase in both services and product sales, with services revenue growing from $15.6 billion to $19.6 billion and product sales revenue increasing from $7.3 billion to $8.5 billion. The growth in revenue can be attributed to robust year-end sales in digital services and strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East.\n\nThe increase in revenue also led to a growth in gross profit, which is the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold. In 2022, the cost of services and cost of sales increased, but the increase in revenue outpaced the rise in costs, resulting in a higher gross profit margin. This improvement in gross profit margin indicates that Schlumberger was able to effectively manage its costs while increasing sales.\n\nOperating profit, which is the profit derived from the company's core business operations, also saw an increase in 2022. This growth can be attributed to the higher revenue and improved gross profit margin. The company's ability to generate more profit from its operations indicates efficiency and effectiveness in managing expenses and maximizing revenue.\n\nNet profit, which is the bottom line profit after all expenses have been deducted from revenue, also increased in 2022. The growth in net profit can be attributed to the higher operating profit and lower interest expenses. The company's ability to reduce interest expenses indicates effective management of debt and financial obligations.\n\nCash flow from operations decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in working capital consumption. The increase in receivables and inventories consumed liquidity, offsetting the positive impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This change in working capital management impacted the cash flow from operations in 2022.

Total revenue increased from $22.9 billion in 2021 to $28.1 billion in 2022, representing a 22% growth. This growth was driven by an increase in both services and product sales, with services revenue growing from $15.6 billion to $19.6 billion and product sales revenue growing from $7.3 billion to $8.5 billion. The increase in revenue can be attributed to robust year-end sales in digital services and strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East.\n\nThe gross profit margin for Schlumberger also improved in 2022. The cost of services and cost of sales increased in line with the revenue growth, but the gross profit margin increased due to the higher revenue growth rate compared to the cost increase rate. This indicates that Schlumberger was able to effectively manage its costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\nOperating profit also saw a positive trend in 2022. Despite an increase in research and engineering expenses, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses, the overall operating profit increased due to the significant revenue growth. This indicates that Schlumberger was able to generate higher profits from its operations, even with increased expenses.\n\nNet profit for Schlumberger more than doubled in 2022 compared to 2021, with net income increasing from $1.9 billion to $3.5 billion. This significant increase in net profit can be attributed to the higher revenue and improved operational efficiency.\n\nInterest expenses decreased in 2022, which contributed to higher net profit. The decrease in interest expenses indicates that Schlumberger was able to manage its debt effectively and reduce its financial costs.\n\nCash flow from operations decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in working capital consumption. The increase in receivables and inventories consumed liquidity, offsetting the positive impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Revenue or Sales:\n- Net Operating Revenues increased from $10,980 million in 2023 to $11,300 million in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 2.9%. This growth can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- The increase in revenue was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs, which affected the overall sales performance.\n\n2. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin:\n- Gross Profit increased from $6,663 million in 2023 to $7,065 million in 2024, reflecting a growth of about 6%. This increase in gross profit can be primarily attributed to the favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes implemented by the company.\n- The Gross Profit Margin also improved from 60.7% in 2023 to 62.5% in 2024. This improvement was driven by the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes, although partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs.\n\n3. Operating Profit and Net Profit:\n- Operating Income decreased from $3,367 million in 2023 to $2,141 million in 2024, representing a decline of approximately 36%. This decrease can be attributed to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, as well as other operating charges incurred during the period.\n- Net Income Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company also decreased slightly from $3,107 million in 2023 to $3,177 million in 2024. This decrease can be attributed to higher income taxes incurred during the period.\n\n4. Interest Expenses and Cash Flow from Operations:\n- Interest Expenses increased from $372 million in 2023 to $382 million in 2024, reflecting a slight increase in the cost of borrowing for the company.\n- Cash Flow from Operations was not explicitly provided in the context, but it can be inferred that the company's cash flow may have been impacted by the changes in revenue, expenses, and profitability during the period.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2024 showed a mixed picture with revenue growth, improved gross profit margin, but lower operating income and slightly lower net income compared to the previous year.

This increase in revenue can be attributed to factors such as sales volume, price, product and geographic mix, and acquisitions and divestitures. However, the company expects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have an unfavorable impact on its full-year 2024 net operating revenues. This indicates that the company may face challenges in maintaining revenue growth due to external factors beyond its control.\n\nIn terms of operating profit, the company saw an improvement in performance as indicated by the increase in gross profit margin. This improvement can be attributed to the company's focus on cost management and pricing strategies. However, the company also incurred higher commodity costs, which may have put pressure on its operating profit margins.\n\nIn terms of net profit, the company's performance may have been impacted by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. These factors could have affected the company's bottom line and resulted in lower net profits compared to the previous year.\n\nOverall, the company's financial performance in 2023 showed improvements in gross profit margin and revenue growth, but challenges such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs may have impacted its profitability and net profit margins. Effective cost management and pricing strategies were key factors driving the positive changes in gross profit margin and revenue growth.", 'pageNumbers': [120, 33, 47], 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                           | March 29, 2024 (in millions) | March 31, 2023 (in millions) |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net Operating Revenues         | $11,300                      | $10,980                      |\n| Cost of goods sold              | $4,235                       | $4,317                       |\n| Gross Profit                    | $7,065                       | $6,663                       |\n| Selling, general and admin. expenses | $3,351                  | $3,185                      |\n| Other operating charges         | $1,573                       | $111                         |\n| Operating Income                | $2,141                       | $3,367                       |\n| Interest income                 | $246                         | $168                         |\n| Interest expense                | $382                         | $372                         |\n| Equity income (loss) -

This increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes. However, this positive impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. The increase in gross profit margin indicates that the company was able to improve its profitability before considering all operating expenses.\n\nIn terms of revenue or sales, the company saw a growth in net operating revenues. This growth was influenced by factors such as sales volume, price, product and geographic mix, as well as acquisitions and divestitures. The company's net operating revenue performance was also impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, with an expectation of an unfavorable impact on full-year 2024 revenues. The company's ability to manage these fluctuations will be crucial in maintaining revenue growth.\n\nOperating profit also saw an improvement, with management evaluating segment performance based on net operating revenues and operating income. The company's ability to monitor and address different factors affecting financial performance at the segment level has contributed to this improvement. However, it is important to note that the size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period, which can impact operating profit.\n\nIn terms of interest expenses, the company manages income taxes and treasury-related items on a global basis within Corporate. This approach helps in effectively managing interest income and expenses. The company's ability to efficiently handle these financial aspects has likely contributed to maintaining stable interest expenses.\n\nOverall, the company's performance in 2023 reflects a strategic focus on improving profitability through pricing initiatives, channel and package mix optimization, and structural changes. However, challenges such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and commodity costs continue to pose risks to the company's financial performance. Effective management of these challenges will be key to sustaining revenue growth, gross profit margin improvement, and overall profitability in the future.", 'pageNumbers': [120, 33, 47], 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 33}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                           | March 29, 2024 (in millions) | March 31, 2023 (in millions) |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net Operating Revenues         | $11,300                      | $10,980                      |\n| Cost of goods sold             | $4,235                       | $4,317                       |\n| Gross Profit                   | $7,065                       | $6,663                       |\n| Selling, general and admin. expenses | $3,351                | $3,185                       |\n| Other operating charges        | $1,573                       | $111                         |\n| Operating Income               | $2,141                       | $3,367                       |\n| Interest income                | $246                         | $168                         |\n| Interest expense               | $382                         | $372                         |\n| Equity income (loss) -

This increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes.

This improvement can be attributed to the higher gross profit margin and effective cost management strategies. However, the company also incurred higher interest expenses in 2023, which had a negative impact on net profit. The increase in interest expenses may be due to higher borrowing costs or increased debt levels.\n\nIn terms of cash flow from operations, the company may have seen fluctuations due to changes in revenue streams, operating expenses, and investment activities.

Additionally, changes in operating income and operating margin may have influenced the cash flow from operations, as these metrics reflect the profitability of the business after considering various expenses. \n\nOverall, the Company's performance in 2023 showed improvements in gross profit margin and operating profit, with potential impacts on revenue, net profit, interest expenses, and cash flow from operations.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 49}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': '| Item                           | 2023            | 2022            | 2021            |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Net Sales                     |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold             |                 |                 |                 |\n| Gross Profit                   |                 |                 |                 |\n| Operating Expenses             |                 |                 |                 |\n| Operating Income               |                 |                 |                 |\n| Interest Income                |                 |                 |                 |\n| Interest Expense               |                 |                 |                 |\n| Income Before Taxes            |                 |                 |                 |\n| Income Tax Expense             |                 |                 |                 |\n| Net Income                    |                 |                 |                 |', 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 105}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 61}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 140}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}]}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide EBITDA calculation for current year in tabular format and add previous year numbers for the same items', 'answer': 'To calculate EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), we need to use the following formula:\n\nEBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization\n\nBased on the provided context, we can calculate EBITDA for the current year (2023) and add the previous year numbers for the same items in a tabular format:\n\n| Item              | 2023 (in millions) | 2022 (in millions) |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Operating Income  | $12,952            | $11,686            |\n| Depreciation      |                    |                    |\n| Amortization      |                    |                    |\n| EBITDA            |                    |                    |\n\nUnfortunately, the context does not provide specific values for Depreciation and Amortization for the current year (2023) and previous year (2022).

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top two reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives that enhanced revenue per unit and a favorable channel and package mix that likely attracted more customers.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit increased due to the higher revenue generated from concentrate operations. The gross profit margin rose from 58.1% in 2022 to 59.5% in 2023. This improvement can be attributed to effective pricing strategies and structural changes that optimized production costs. However, these gains were partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin's increase reflects the company's ability to manage costs effectively while enhancing revenue. The margin rose due to favorable pricing initiatives and a shift towards concentrate operations, which typically yield higher margins.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit and improved gross profit margin suggest a positive trend in operating profit as well. The top reasons for this would be the increased efficiency in operations and the strategic focus on higher-margin products.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the overall improvements in gross profit and operating profit likely contributed to a stronger net profit position. The primary reasons would include reduced operational inefficiencies and better cost management.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but a global management approach to treasury-related items suggests that interest expenses were managed effectively, potentially leading to lower costs.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While cash flow specifics were not mentioned, the increase in gross profit and revenues likely contributed positively to cash flow from operations, driven by improved operational efficiency and revenue generation.\n\nOverall, the companys strategic focus on concentrate operations and effective pricing initiatives were key drivers of its improved financial performance in 2023.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 41}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [47, 120, 47], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [41]}}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here is a table summarizing the profit and loss statement for the current year (2024) and the previous year (2023).

Please provide commentary', 'answer': "To determine how much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next year and whether the company can pay this from its liquidity, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.\n\n1. **Total Debt Issuances in 2023**: The company had total debt issuances of $6,891 million in 2023, which includes:\n   - $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days.\n   - $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - $233 million of long-term debt issuances.\n\n2. **Short-term Debt**: The portion of the debt that is likely to be repaid within the next year includes:\n   - The $222 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - A portion of the $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, which may also include amounts due within the next year. However, the exact amount due within the next year is not specified.\n\n3. **Total Short-term Debt**: For the sake of this analysis, we can consider the $222 million as the minimum amount due within the next year. The total short-term debt (including the portion of the $6,436 million that is due) could be higher, but we do not have the exact breakdown.\n\n4. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - An additional $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n5. **Total Liquidity**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n6. **Can the Company Pay the Debt?**: Given that the company has at least $18.3 billion in liquidity and the minimum short-term debt due within the next year is $222 million, it is clear that the company can easily cover its short-term debt obligations. Even if we consider a significant portion of the $6,436 million as due within the next year, the total liquidity still far exceeds the potential repayment obligations.\n\n**Commentary**: The company's strong liquidity position, with substantial cash reserves and available credit, indicates that it is well-prepared to meet its short-term debt obligations. This financial strength not only allows the company to manage its current liabilities effectively but also positions it favorably for future borrowing and investment opportunities. The prudent management of debt levels and the ability to borrow at reasonable rates further enhance the company's financial stability. Overall, the company appears to be in a robust position to handle its debt repayment requirements in the coming year.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 55}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 52}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 48}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 55}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [55, 52, 55], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [48]}}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide a summary of changes in networth and debt for the current year against previous year', 'answer': "To summarize the changes in net worth and debt for the current year (2023) compared to the previous year (2022), we can analyze the provided financial data step by step.\n\n### Net Worth (Equity)\n1. **Total Equity in 2023**: $48,633 million\n2. **Total Equity in 2022**: $44,925 million\n3. **Change in Total Equity**: \n   - $48,633 million (2023) - $44,925 million (2022) = **$3,708 million increase**\n\n### Debt (Liabilities)\n1. **Total Liabilities in 2023**: $60,918 million\n2. **Total Liabilities in 2022**: $58,320 million\n3. **Change in Total Liabilities**: \n   - $60,918 million (2023) - $58,320 million (2022) = **$2,598 million increase**\n\n### Summary of Changes\n- **Net Worth (Equity)** increased by **$3,708 million** from 2022 to 2023.\n- **Total Debt (Liabilities)** increased by **$2,598 million** from 2022 to 2023.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the company experienced a significant increase in net worth, indicating improved financial health, while also seeing an increase in total debt, which may suggest additional borrowing or increased obligations.

Heres a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Corporate Backup Lines of Credit**:\n   - **Amount**: $4,550 million\n   - **Purpose**: General corporate purposes\n   - **Expiry**: These lines of credit expire at various times through 2028. The exact expiry dates for each line are not specified, but they are all set to expire before the end of 2028.\n\n2. **Unused Lines of Credit and Other Short-Term Credit Facilities**:\n   - **Total Amount**: $6,159 million as of December 31, 2023\n   - **Breakdown**: This total includes the $4,550 million in corporate backup lines of credit mentioned above. The remaining amount consists of other short-term credit facilities and lines of credit related to international operations.\n\n3. **Outstanding Commercial Paper Borrowings**:\n   - **Amount**: $4,209 million as of December 31, 2023\n   - **Interest Rate**: The weighted-average interest rate for these borrowings was 5.3% as of the same date.\n\n4. **International Operations**:\n   - The company also had $348 million in lines of credit, short-term credit facilities, and other short-term borrowings related to its international operations as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Commentary:\nThe company appears to have a robust financial structure with significant backup lines of credit available for general corporate purposes, totaling $4,550 million. The fact that there were no borrowings under these lines during 2023 suggests a strong liquidity position, allowing the company to operate without relying on these credit facilities. The expiry of these lines through 2028 indicates a long-term planning approach, providing the company with flexibility in managing its financial obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $4,209 million, with a relatively higher interest rate of 5.3%, indicates that the company is actively utilizing short-term debt instruments to meet its financing needs. The presence of $6,159 million in unused lines of credit further enhances the company's financial stability, allowing it to respond to unforeseen circumstances or investment opportunities without immediate pressure on cash flow.\n\nOverall, the company's credit facilities reflect a strategic approach to managing liquidity and financing, ensuring that it has access to funds when needed while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 89}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 52}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 18}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 89}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [89, 52, 89], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [18]}}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide the debt repayment schedule for the company in a tabular format', 'answer': "Based on the provided context, here is the debt repayment schedule for the company as of December 31, 2023, formatted in a tabular format:\n\n| **Debt Type**                          | **Total** | **2024** | **2025-2026** | **2027-2028** | **2029 and Thereafter** |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| Commercial paper borrowings            | $4,209    | $4,209   | $            | $             | $                      |\n| Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings | $348      | $348     | $            | $             | $                      |\n| Current maturities of long-term debt   | $1,960    | $1,960   | $            | $             | $                      |\n| Long-term debt, net of current maturities | $36,694   | $      | $2,936        | $7,579         | $26,179                 |\n| Estimated interest payments             | $9,855    | $878     | $1,120        | $909           | $6,948                  |\n| Accrued income taxes                   | $2,649    | $1,569   | $1,080        | $             | $                      |\n| Purchase obligations                   | $23,392   | $13,701  | $3,330        | $2,057         | $4,304                  |\n| Marketing obligations                   | $4,076    | $2,563   | $756          | $403           | $354                    |\n| Lease obligations                       | $2,007    | $444     | $562          | $363           | $638                    |\n| Acquisition obligations                 | $3,030    | $13      | $3,017        | $             | $                      |\n| Held-for-sale and related obligations   | $903      | $809     | $64           | $21            | $9                      |\n| **Total contractual obligations**      | **$89,123** | **$26,494** | **$12,865** | **$11,332** | **$38,432**             |\n\nThis table summarizes the company's debt repayment schedule, including various types of debt and their respective payment timelines.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 140}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [57, 57, 140], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [57]}}]

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives that enhanced revenue per unit and a favorable channel mix that likely improved distribution efficiency.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit increased due to the rise in net operating revenues, driven by the aforementioned pricing strategies. Additionally, structural changes within the company may have optimized production processes, contributing to higher gross profit levels.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin rose from 58.1% in 2022 to 59.5% in 2023. This improvement can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives that allowed the company to maintain higher prices despite increased commodity costs. Furthermore, a favorable package mix likely contributed to this margin expansion, as higher-margin products gained a larger share of sales.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit and improved gross profit margin suggest a positive trend in operating profit as well. The top reasons for this would be the effective management of operating expenses and the increased contribution from higher-margin concentrate operations.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the overall improvements in gross profit and operating profit would likely lead to a favorable net profit outcome. The primary reasons would include enhanced revenue generation and effective cost management.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but a global management approach to treasury-related items suggests that the company is actively managing its debt levels, which could stabilize or reduce interest expenses.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While not explicitly mentioned, improved profitability metrics typically correlate with stronger cash flow from operations.

However, the exact amount due within the next year is not specified.\n\n3. **Total Short-term Debt**: For the sake of this analysis, we can conservatively estimate that at least the $222 million is due within the next year. The total short-term debt could be higher, but we will focus on the known amount.\n\n4. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - An additional $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n5. **Total Liquidity**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n6. **Comparison of Debt Due and Liquidity**: \n   - The known short-term debt due within the next year is at least $222 million.\n   - The total liquidity available is $18.3 billion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe company has sufficient liquidity to cover its short-term debt obligations. Even if we consider the total short-term debt to be significantly higher than $222 million, the company's liquidity position remains strong enough to manage these obligations comfortably. \n\n### Commentary:\nThe company's ability to maintain a strong liquidity position, coupled with its access to reasonable borrowing rates, indicates prudent financial management.

The fact that there were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2023 suggests that the company is maintaining a conservative approach to its debt management, possibly relying on its cash flow and other resources to meet operational needs.\n\nThe expiry of these credit lines through 2028 indicates a long-term planning strategy, allowing the company to secure funding options well into the future. The commercial paper borrowings, while substantial, are also managed with a relatively high interest rate, which reflects the current market conditions.

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives and an improved channel and package mix that enhanced sales performance.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit rose due to the increased revenue from concentrate operations. The gross profit margin improved to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. This increase can be attributed to favorable pricing strategies and structural changes within the company that optimized production costs.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin's rise reflects the company's ability to manage costs effectively while increasing sales. The two primary reasons for this improvement are the successful implementation of pricing initiatives and a favorable mix of products sold, which contributed to higher profitability.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit and improved revenue mix likely contributed positively to operating profit. The main drivers would be the enhanced performance of concentrate operations and effective cost management.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the overall increase in gross profit and revenue suggests a positive trend. The two key factors influencing net profit would be the reduction in costs associated with favorable pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but the management's global evaluation of treasury-related items suggests a focus on optimizing financing costs.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While cash flow specifics are not mentioned, improved gross profit and revenue likely contributed to stronger cash flow from operations, driven by increased sales and effective cost management.\n\nOverall, the companys strategic focus on concentrate operations and pricing initiatives has led to improved financial performance in 2023 compared to the previous year.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 41}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [47, 120, 47], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [41]}}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here is a table summarizing the profit and loss statement for the current year (2024) and the previous year (2023).

Please provide commentary', 'answer': "To determine how much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next year and whether the company can pay this from its liquidity, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.\n\n1. **Total Debt Issuances in 2023**: The company had total debt issuances of $6,891 million in 2023, which includes:\n   - $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days.\n   - $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - $233 million of long-term debt issuances.\n\n2. **Short-term Debt**: The portion of the debt that is likely to be repaid within the next year includes:\n   - The $222 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - A portion of the $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, which may also include amounts maturing within the next year. However, the exact amount maturing within the next year is not specified.\n\n3. **Total Short-term Debt**: For the sake of this analysis, we can consider the $222 million as the known short-term debt that will be repaid within the next year. The total short-term debt could be higher if we assume some of the $6,436 million will also mature within the next year, but we do not have that specific information.\n\n4. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n5. **Total Liquidity**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n6. **Comparison of Debt to Liquidity**: The known short-term debt to be repaid within the next year is $222 million. Given the total liquidity of $18.3 billion, the company has more than sufficient funds to cover this short-term obligation.\n\n### Commentary:\nThe company appears to be in a strong liquidity position, with ample cash and credit available to meet its short-term debt obligations. Even if we consider additional short-term debt maturing within the next year from the $6,436 million category, the company's liquidity far exceeds its immediate repayment needs. This indicates a robust financial health and effective debt management strategy, allowing the company to comfortably meet its obligations while maintaining a strong capital position.

The outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $4,209 million indicate that the company is actively utilizing short-term debt instruments to manage its financing needs, with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.3% as of the end of 2023.\n\nOverall, the company appears to be in a strong position with ample credit facilities, which can be crucial for operational flexibility and strategic investments in the future.

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top two reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives that enhanced revenue generation and a favorable channel and package mix that likely attracted more customers.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit increased due to the higher revenue from concentrate operations. The gross profit margin rose to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. This improvement can be attributed to effective pricing strategies and structural changes within the company that optimized production costs. However, these gains were partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin's increase reflects the company's ability to manage costs effectively while enhancing revenue. The top reasons for this improvement include successful pricing initiatives and a favorable mix of products sold, which contributed to higher profitability.\n\n**Operating Profit and Net Profit**: While specific figures for operating and net profit were not provided, the overall increase in gross profit and revenue suggests a positive trend in these areas. The primary reasons for potential increases in operating and net profit would be the enhanced revenue from concentrate operations and improved cost management.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific details on interest expenses, but a global management approach to treasury-related items suggests that interest expenses may have been managed effectively, potentially leading to lower costs.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: Although not explicitly mentioned, improved gross profit and revenue likely contributed to stronger cash flow from operations, driven by increased sales and effective cost management.\n\nIn summary, the companys financial performance in 2023 reflects strategic initiatives that enhanced revenue and profitability, despite challenges from external factors.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 41}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [47, 120, 47], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [41]}}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here is a table summarizing the profit and loss statement for the current year (2024) and the previous year (2023).

The total short-term debt (including both categories) is:\n   - $6,436 million (maturities greater than 90 days) + $222 million (maturities of 90 days or less) = $6,658 million.\n\n3. **Long-Term Debt**: The long-term debt issued is $233 million, which is not due within the next year.\n\n4. **Total Debt to be Repaid in the Next Year**: The total debt that is due within the next year is primarily the short-term debt, which is $6,658 million.\n\n5. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - An additional $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n6. **Total Liquidity Available**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n7. **Comparison of Debt Due and Liquidity**: The total debt due in the next year is $6,658 million, while the total liquidity available is $18.3 billion.\n\n### Commentary:\nThe company has a strong liquidity position, with $18.3 billion available to cover its short-term obligations. The total debt that needs to be repaid in the next year is $6,658 million, which is significantly less than the available liquidity.

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top reasons for this change include the successful implementation of favorable pricing initiatives and an improved channel and package mix that enhanced overall sales.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit increased due to the higher revenue contribution from concentrate operations, which typically yield better margins. Additionally, the company benefited from structural changes that optimized production efficiency. However, this was partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin rose from 58.1% in 2022 to 59.5% in 2023. This improvement can be attributed to favorable pricing initiatives and a better product mix, which allowed the company to maintain profitability despite rising costs.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit margin suggests a potential rise in operating profit as well. The top reasons for this could include improved operational efficiencies and cost management strategies.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the trends in gross profit and operating profit suggest a positive outlook. The primary reasons for this could be the enhanced revenue from concentrate operations and effective cost control measures.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but the management's global evaluation of treasury-related items indicates a focus on optimizing financing costs.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While not explicitly mentioned, improved gross profit and operating efficiencies likely contributed to stronger cash flow from operations, driven by increased revenues and effective cost management.\n\nOverall, the companys strategic focus on concentrate operations and pricing initiatives has positively impacted its financial performance in 2023.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 120}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 41}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 47}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [47, 120, 47], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [41]}}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here is a table summarizing the profit and loss statement for the current year (2024) and the previous year (2023).

Please provide commentary', 'answer': "To determine how much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next year and whether the company can pay this from its liquidity, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.\n\n1. **Total Debt Issued in 2023**: The company had total debt issuances of $6,891 million in 2023, which includes:\n   - $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days.\n   - $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - $233 million of long-term debt issuances.\n\n2. **Short-Term Debt**: The portion of the debt that is likely to be repaid in the next year primarily consists of the commercial paper and short-term debt. The total short-term debt (including both categories) is:\n   - $6,436 million (maturities greater than 90 days) + $222 million (maturities of 90 days or less) = $6,658 million.\n\n3. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - Additionally, the company has $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n4. **Total Liquidity**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n5. **Debt Repayment Capability**: The company has a total short-term debt of $6,658 million due in the next year. Given the total liquidity of $18.3 billion, the company can comfortably cover its short-term debt obligations.\n\n### Commentary:\nThe company is in a strong liquidity position, with sufficient cash and equivalents to cover its short-term debt obligations. The total short-term debt of $6,658 million is significantly less than the available liquidity of $18.3 billion. This indicates that the company can not only meet its immediate debt repayment requirements but also has a substantial buffer for other operational needs or unexpected expenses. Furthermore, the company's ability to borrow at reasonable interest rates enhances its financial flexibility, allowing it to manage its debt effectively while maintaining a strong capital position.

The remaining amount would be related to other short-term credit facilities and lines of credit, although the specific amounts for these are not detailed in the context.\n\n3. **Commercial Paper Borrowings**:\n   - **Outstanding Amount**: $4,209 million as of December 31, 2023.\n   - **Interest Rate**: The weighted-average interest rate for these borrowings was 5.3% as of the same date.\n\n4. **International Operations**:\n   - **Additional Short-Term Borrowings**: The company had $348 million in lines of credit, short-term credit facilities, and other short-term borrowings related to its international operations as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Commentary:\nThe company has a robust set of credit facilities, with a significant portion allocated to corporate backup lines of credit, which provides financial flexibility for general corporate needs.

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives and an improved channel and package mix that enhanced sales performance.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit rose due to the increased revenue from concentrate operations. The gross profit margin improved to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. Key factors contributing to this growth were favorable pricing strategies and structural changes that optimized production efficiency.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin's increase reflects the company's ability to manage costs effectively despite challenges such as foreign currency fluctuations and rising commodity costs. The top reasons for the margin improvement include successful pricing initiatives and a favorable product mix that prioritized higher-margin offerings.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit and improved revenue mix likely contributed positively to operating profit. The main reasons for this would be the enhanced operational efficiency and the strategic focus on higher-margin products.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the overall improvements in gross profit and revenue suggest a positive trend. The primary reasons for potential net profit growth would be reduced operational costs and effective management of foreign exchange impacts.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but a global management approach to treasury-related items suggests a focus on optimizing financing costs.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While not explicitly mentioned, improved gross profit and revenue likely led to enhanced cash flow from operations.

Please provide commentary', 'answer': 'To determine how much of the total debt is to be repaid in the next year and whether the company can pay this from its liquidity, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.\n\n1. **Total Debt Issuances in 2023**: The company had total debt issuances of $6,891 million in 2023, which includes:\n   - $6,436 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days.\n   - $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.\n   - $233 million of long-term debt issuances.\n\n2. **Short-Term Debt**: The portion of the debt that is likely to be repaid in the next year primarily consists of the commercial paper and short-term debt. The context mentions:\n   - $6,436 million (maturities greater than 90 days) and $222 million (maturities of 90 days or less). \n   - The $222 million is due within the next year, while a portion of the $6,436 million may also be due depending on its specific maturity schedule.\n\n3. **Liquidity Position**: As of December 31, 2023, the company has:\n   - Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable securities totaling $13.7 billion.\n   - An additional $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit.\n\n4. **Total Liquidity**: The total liquidity available to the company is:\n   - $13.7 billion (cash and equivalents) + $4.6 billion (unused credit lines) = $18.3 billion.\n\n5. **Debt Repayment Capability**: \n   - The company has at least $222 million of short-term debt due within the next year, and potentially more from the $6,436 million depending on its maturity schedule.\n   - Given the total liquidity of $18.3 billion, the company is well-positioned to cover its short-term debt obligations.\n\n**Commentary**: The company appears to have a strong liquidity position, significantly exceeding its short-term debt obligations. With $18.3 billion in liquidity against at least $222 million due in the next year, the company can comfortably meet its repayment obligations. Additionally, the companys ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates further enhances its financial flexibility.

The fact that there were no borrowings under these lines during 2023 suggests a strong liquidity position, allowing the company to operate without relying on these credit facilities. \n\nThe expiry of the corporate backup lines through 2028 indicates a long-term planning approach, ensuring that the company has access to funds if needed in the future. The commercial paper borrowings, while substantial, are also managed with a relatively high interest rate, reflecting the current market conditions. \n\nOverall, the company appears to be in a solid financial position with ample credit facilities to support its operations and growth strategies.

This shift indicates a strategic focus on higher-margin concentrate products. The top reasons for this increase include favorable pricing initiatives and an improved channel and package mix that enhanced sales performance.\n\n**Gross Profit**: The gross profit rose due to the increased revenue from concentrate operations. The gross profit margin improved to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. Key factors contributing to this growth were favorable pricing initiatives and structural changes that optimized production costs.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin**: The gross profit margin's increase reflects the company's ability to manage costs effectively while enhancing pricing strategies. The two primary reasons for this improvement are the successful implementation of pricing initiatives and a favorable mix of products sold, which allowed for higher margins.\n\n**Operating Profit**: While specific figures for operating profit were not provided, the increase in gross profit and improved revenue mix likely contributed positively to operating profit. The main reasons for this would be the enhanced revenue from concentrate operations and effective cost management strategies.\n\n**Net Profit**: Although net profit figures were not detailed, the overall improvements in gross profit and operating efficiency suggest a positive trend. The top reasons for potential net profit growth include increased revenues from higher-margin products and effective management of operating expenses.\n\n**Interest Expenses**: The context does not provide specific changes in interest expenses, but a global management approach to treasury-related items suggests that interest expenses were likely managed effectively, contributing to overall financial health.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations**: While cash flow specifics are not mentioned, the increase in gross profit and revenues would typically lead to improved cash flow from operations.

With a significant amount of liquidity available, including cash and unused credit lines, it can comfortably meet its upcoming debt repayments.

The fact that there were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2023 suggests that the company is maintaining a conservative approach to its debt management, possibly relying on its cash flows for operational needs rather than drawing on these lines.\n\nThe expiry of the corporate backup lines of credit through 2028 indicates a long-term planning strategy, allowing the company to secure funding options well into the future. The substantial amount of unused lines of credit also reflects a strong liquidity position, which can be advantageous in times of financial uncertainty or for funding new opportunities.\n\nOverall, the company appears to be in a solid financial position with ample credit facilities available, which can support its operational and strategic initiatives moving forward.', 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 89}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 52}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 18}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 89}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [89, 52, 89], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [18]}}, {'category': 'Balance Sheet', 'question': 'Provide the debt repayment schedule for the company in a tabular format', 'answer': "Based on the provided context, here is the debt repayment schedule for the company as of December 31, 2023, formatted in a tabular format:\n\n| **Debt Type**                          | **Total** | **2024** | **2025-2026** | **2027-2028** | **2029 and Thereafter** |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Commercial paper borrowings            | $4,209    | $4,209   | $            | $             | $                       |\n| Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings | $348      | $348     | $            | $             | $                       |\n| Current maturities of long-term debt   | $1,960    | $1,960   | $            | $             | $                       |\n| Long-term debt, net of current maturities | $36,694   | $      | $2,936        | $7,579         | $26,179                  |\n| Estimated interest payments             | $9,855    | $878     | $1,120        | $909           | $6,948                   |\n| Accrued income taxes                   | $2,649    | $1,569   | $1,080        | $             | $                       |\n| Purchase obligations                   | $23,392   | $13,701  | $3,330        | $2,057         | $4,304                   |\n| Marketing obligations                   | $4,076    | $2,563   | $756          | $403           | $354                     |\n| Lease obligations                       | $2,007    | $444     | $562          | $363           | $638                     |\n| Acquisition obligations                 | $3,030    | $13      | $3,017        | $             | $                       |\n| Held-for-sale and related obligations   | $903      | $809     | $64           | $21            | $9                       |\n| **Total Contractual Obligations**      | **$89,123** | **$26,494** | **$12,865** | **$11,332** | **$38,432**              |\n\nThis table summarizes the company's debt repayment schedule, including various types of obligations and their respective payment timelines.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': 57}, {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': 140}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Coca Cola 10K.pdf': [57, 57, 140], 'Coca Cola 10Q.pdf': [57]}}]

The company has integrated operations, including those acquired in the Mexico Acquisition, which are now part of this segment.\n\n- **Consumer Packaging**: This segment deals with packaging solutions aimed at consumer products. The company has made adjustments to its operational structure, moving certain consumer converting operations in Latin America into the Corrugated Packaging segment effective January 1, 2023.\n\n- **Global Paper**: This segment encompasses the commercial paper operations, generating revenue from the sale of containerboard, paperboard, and specialty grades. It serves various markets, including corrugated packaging, folding carton, food service, liquid packaging, tobacco, and commercial print.\n\n- **Distribution**: This segment is responsible for the distribution of the company's products, although specific details about its operations are not provided in the context.\n\n### Commentary on Changes in Segment Performance:\n\nThe context indicates that there have been some significant changes in segment performance compared to the previous year:\n\n1. **Integration of Operations**: The acquisition in Mexico has been integrated into the Corrugated Packaging segment, which may have contributed to an increase in its operational capacity and revenue potential.\n\n2. **Reallocation of Resources**: The movement of certain consumer converting operations from the Consumer Packaging segment to the Corrugated Packaging segment reflects a strategic decision to align resources more effectively. This change is aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and performance assessment by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).\n\n3. **Revenue Trends in Global Paper**: The Global Paper segment's sales to external customers accounted for 21.5%, 27.9%, and 26.6% of net sales in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. This indicates a decline in the proportion of net sales attributed to this segment in 2023 compared to 2022, suggesting potential challenges or shifts in market demand for paper products.\n\nOverall, the adjustments in segment structure and the performance metrics indicate a proactive approach by the company to optimize its operations and respond to market dynamics.

However, there is no mention of share repurchases in fiscal 2023 that exceed $500 million.\n\n4. **Net Cash Used for Financing Activities**: The net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2023 was $193.5 million, which included cash dividends and a net addition to debt due to the Mexico Acquisition. However, this figure does not represent a single event exceeding $500 million.\n\nIn summary, the primary material event in fiscal 2023 that exceeds $500 million is the **Mexico Acquisition**, which involved a significant increase in debt. The cash dividends paid, while substantial, do not meet the $500 million threshold. There are no other acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs mentioned that exceed this amount.', 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Westrock 10k.pdf': 112}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 185}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 30}, {'Westrock 10q.pdf': 48}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Westrock 10k.pdf': [112, 185, 30], 'Westrock 10q.pdf': [48]}}, {'category': 'Senior Management', 'question': 'Provide names of senior management and their designations, as bullet points', 'answer': '- David B.

This decrease of approximately 4.4% can be attributed primarily to reduced demand in key markets and increased competition, which pressured pricing and sales volumes.\n\nGross profit also saw a decline, falling from $4,019 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023. This drop of about 10.8% reflects the decrease in sales and an increase in the cost of goods sold, which rose from $17,237.5 million to $16,725.5 million. The gross profit margin consequently decreased, indicating a less favorable cost structure and pricing environment.\n\nOperating profit turned negative, with a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023 compared to a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022. This significant shift is largely due to increased restructuring costs and an impairment of goodwill, which totaled $1,893 million in 2023, compared to only $26 million in 2022.\n\nNet loss attributable to the Obligor Group was reported at $98.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, indicating ongoing challenges. The primary reasons for this loss include high interest expenses, which increased from $318.8 million in 2022 to $417.9 million in 2023, and substantial restructuring costs.\n\nCash flow from operations was negatively impacted by these factors, as the company faced challenges in maintaining liquidity amid declining sales and increased operational costs. The top reasons for cash flow issues include reduced profitability and higher working capital requirements.\n\nIn summary, the company faced significant challenges in 2023, with declining sales, increased costs, and substantial impairments leading to a negative operating environment.', 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Westrock 10q.pdf': 50}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 102}, {'Westrock 10q.pdf': 37}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 116}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Westrock 10q.pdf': [50, 37], 'Westrock 10k.pdf': [102, 116]}}, {'category': 'Profit & Loss', 'question': 'Provide a table of all profit & loss statement of current year starting with net sales and ending with net income and the previous year details for the same items.', 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here is a table summarizing the profit and loss statement for the current year (2023) and the previous year (2022):\n\n| Item                                           | Year Ended September 30, 2023 | Year Ended September 30, 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Net Sales                                     | $4,726.7 million              | $5,277.6 million              |\n| Cost of Goods Sold                            | $3,946.6 million              | $4,357.6 million              |\n| Gross Profit                                  | $780.1 million                | $920.0 million                |\n| Selling, General and Administrative Expense    | $499.5 million                | $498.9 million                |\n| Selling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization Expense | $79.0 million                 | $86.2 million                 |\n| Restructuring and Other Costs, Net            | $81.2 million                 | $435.8 million                |\n| Impairment of Goodwill                        | $0.0 million                  | $1,893.0 million              |\n| Operating Profit (Loss)                       | $120.4 million                | $(1,993.9) million            |\n| Interest Expense, Net                         | $(100.8) million              | $(108.4) million              |\n| Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Cost | $(0.6) million                | $(6.0) million                |\n| (Loss) Income Before Income Taxes             | $(1,704.6) million            | $1,218.8 million              |\n| Income Tax Benefit (Expense)                  | $60.4 million                 | Not provided                  |\n| Consolidated Net (Loss) Income                | $(1,644.2) million            | Not provided                  |\n\nNote: The income tax expense for the previous year (2022) and the consolidated net income for the previous year are not provided in the context.

With a workforce of over 55,000 team members, the company operates globally, with facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. WestRock's extensive network includes mills, converting, and recycling facilities, which, combined with its expertise in automation technology and materials science, positions the company to deliver on its commitment to sustainability.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, WestRock emphasized its dedication to risk management, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and cybersecurity measures. The company actively engages with its stockholders, having conducted outreach to those representing over 60% of its outstanding shares in 2023. Discussions during this outreach focused on key topics such as human capital management, diversity and inclusion, corporate governance, and sustainability initiatives.

The company has integrated operations acquired in Mexico into this segment, aligning with its internal operational structure.\n\n- **Consumer Packaging**: This segment deals with packaging solutions aimed at consumer products. Certain operations in Latin America were moved into the Corrugated Packaging segment effective January 1, 2023, indicating a strategic shift in how the company manages its resources.\n\n- **Global Paper**: This segment encompasses commercial paper operations, generating revenue from the sale of containerboard, paperboard, and specialty grades. It serves various markets, including corrugated packaging, folding carton, food service, liquid packaging, tobacco, and commercial print.\n\n- **Distribution**: While specific details about this segment are not provided in the context, it typically involves the logistics and distribution of the company's products to customers.\n\n### Commentary on Changes in Segment Performance\n\nThe context indicates that the company has made significant adjustments to its segments, particularly with the integration of operations from the Mexico Acquisition into the Corrugated Packaging segment and the reallocation of certain consumer converting operations from Latin America. These changes reflect a strategic alignment with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses financial performance and allocates resources.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, the Global Paper segment's sales to external customers accounted for 21.5%, 27.9%, and 26.6% of net sales in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. This indicates a decline in the proportion of net sales attributed to the Global Paper segment from 2022 to 2023, suggesting potential challenges in this area or shifts in market demand.\n\nOverall, the adjustments in segment structure and the performance metrics highlight the company's ongoing evaluation of its operations and market positioning, particularly in response to changing market dynamics and internal management strategies. The company is also preparing for the implementation of ASU 2023-07, which will enhance disclosures about segment performance, potentially providing more clarity on these changes in the future.", 'pageNumbersWithSourceName': [{'Westrock 10k.pdf': 98}, {'Westrock 10q.pdf': 9}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 167}, {'Westrock 10k.pdf': 70}], 'prettyPageNumberFormat': {'Westrock 10k.pdf': [98, 167, 70], 'Westrock 10q.pdf': [9]}}, {'category': 'Company Overview', 'question': 'What are the revenue generating product lines and how they individually performed in current year.

This decrease of approximately 4.4% can be attributed primarily to reduced demand in key markets and increased competition, which pressured pricing strategies. Gross profit also fell from $4,019 million in 2022 to $3,584.5 million in 2023, reflecting a gross profit margin decline from 18.9% to 17.7%. The margin contraction is largely due to higher costs of goods sold, which increased from $17,237.5 million to $16,725.5 million, driven by inflationary pressures on raw materials and supply chain disruptions.\n\nOperating profit shifted from a profit of $1,326.8 million in 2022 to a loss of $1,511.5 million in 2023. This significant downturn is primarily due to a substantial increase in restructuring costs, which rose from $383 million to $859.2 million, and a notable impairment of goodwill amounting to $1,893 million, which was not present in the previous year.\n\nNet loss attributable to the Obligor Group was reported at $98.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a profit in the previous year. This shift is influenced by the aforementioned operating losses and increased interest expenses, which rose from $318.8 million in 2022 to $417.9 million in 2023, reflecting higher borrowing costs and increased debt levels.\n\nCash flow from operations has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context, but the overall financial strain suggests a potential decline in operational cash flow due to reduced profitability and increased expenses.
